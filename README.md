## Data Handling & Privacy

The original dataset used for this dashboard contains sensitive
information such as IP addresses and security-related identifiers.
To maintain data privacy and ethical standards, the raw dataset
has not been uploaded to this repository.

All analysis and visualizations were performed on sanitized data.

## Sample Sanitized Data

The sanitized dataset includes two views:

- compliance_summary: High-level security posture metrics such as total checks,
  pass/fail counts, and CIS/PCI/ISO compliance coverage.

- detailed_compliance_results: Control-level compliance results used to
  generate the dashboard visualizations.

All sensitive identifiers have been masked to preserve confidentiality.
